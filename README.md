# Swift-Closures
Starting with a single Swift Playground for closure play. 

Open a Swift Playground using Xcode, modify the code. Write your own. The panel on the right is the results/live view. The console will appear at the bottom of the Playground if you're using print commands. Errors will show up there as well. The bottom left has a show/hide console button, and next to that is a stop/run Playground button. You will also see a small button in the code editor you can use to run the Playground.
